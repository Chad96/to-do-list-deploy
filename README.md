# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend. The application allows users to register, log in, and manage their tasks using a Kanban board setup with move task functionality. Tasks are color-coded based on their priority level.

3. **Priority-Based Color Coding**:
   - Tasks are color-coded based on their priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

4. **Kanban Board**:
   - Tasks are organized into columns for better visualization and management.
